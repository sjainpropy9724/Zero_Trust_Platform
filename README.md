Instructions on how to run the code.
1. Install docker desktop and start the engine.
2. Download this repo and create a "uploads" folder in this directory.
3. create a Python Virtual environment in this directory by running "python -m venv venv"
4. Then run ./venv/Scripts/activate
5. Then run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
6. Then run "docker-compose up --build" (This will take a significant amount of time)
7. Then in an another terminal run "streamlit run dashboard.py"
